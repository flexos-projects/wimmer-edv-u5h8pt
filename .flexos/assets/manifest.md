# Asset Manifest

Central registry for all project assets. Every image, icon, font, and file used by the project is tracked here — what it is, where it came from, where it's stored, and where it's used.

Assets are stored in Firebase Storage under `projects/{projectId}/assets/`. The `storageUrl` field contains the full download URL once uploaded. Before upload, assets may exist only as references (source URL, description, or placeholder).

## How Assets Work

### Storage

All binary assets (images, icons, files) are uploaded to Firebase Storage:

```
projects/{projectId}/assets/
├── logo.svg
├── logo-light.svg
├── logo-dark.svg
├── icon-192.png
├── icon-512.png
├── icon-maskable.png
├── og-image.png
└── uploads/          ← user-uploaded files
```

The `storageUrl` field is populated after upload with the full Firebase download URL. Before upload, it's empty — the asset exists as a specification only.

### Fonts

Fonts are loaded from external sources (Google Fonts, Adobe Fonts) or self-hosted. The `sourceUrl` links to where the font can be previewed or downloaded. Fonts don't need Firebase Storage — they're referenced by URL in CSS.

### Referencing Assets

Use asset `id` values in specs and prototypes:

- In specs: "The header displays `logo-primary` at 32px height"
- In prototypes: `<img src="{{asset:logo-primary}}">`
- In CSS: `--font-heading: '{{asset:font-heading.family}}', {{asset:font-heading.fallback}}`

### Adding New Assets

Add entries to the `assets` array above. Every asset needs at minimum: `id`, `type`, `name`, `description`, and `usage`. The `source` field documents where the asset came from (AI generated, user uploaded, external service, derived from another asset).

### Asset Types

- **image** — Photos, illustrations, backgrounds, screenshots
- **icon** — App icons, favicons, UI icons
- **font** — Typefaces (heading, body, mono, display)
- **file** — Documents, PDFs, data files, videos
