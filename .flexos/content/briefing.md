This is unstructured background information the client or founder has provided about their project, company, or idea. It's not a spec or a schema — it's context. The AI reads this when generating docs, copy, or prototypes to ground its output in real-world details.

This might contain: company history, target market insights, competitor notes, brand preferences, past attempts, personal motivation, domain expertise, or anything else the founder wants the AI to know.

# Client Briefing

(This is where the founder writes — or pastes — everything the AI should know about the project that doesn't fit neatly into a spec. Free-form, no structure required.)

## About the Company

(Who are you? What's the backstory? How did this idea come about?)

## The Problem

(What's broken? Who's affected? How do people deal with it today?)

## The Vision

(What does success look like? What's the dream outcome?)

## What We've Tried

(Any previous attempts, prototypes, or competitors studied?)

## Constraints

(Budget, timeline, technical limitations, team size, regulatory requirements?)

## Tone & Personality

(How should this product feel? Formal? Playful? Technical? Friendly? Any brands to reference as inspiration?)

## Anything Else

(Dump anything here. The AI will use it as context for better generation.)
