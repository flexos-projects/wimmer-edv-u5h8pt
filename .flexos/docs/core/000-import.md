# Project Origin

> Every FlexOS project has an origin story. This document records how the project was created and what source material informed it.

## Source

Describe how this project came into existence. Was it imagined from a description? Imported from an existing GitHub repository? Scraped from a live website? Created from a template?

- **Type:** imagination | github_import | website_scrape | blank | template
- **Source:** (URL, description, or "from scratch")
- **Date:** (when the project was created)

## Original Input

Capture the raw input that started this project — the brain dump, the GitHub URL, the website, or the template name. This is the seed everything else grew from.

## What Was Learned

If this project was imported or scraped, summarize the key insights extracted from the source material. What was the original project trying to be? What worked? What was missing?

## Decisions Made

Record any early decisions about scope, direction, or technology that were made during project creation. Why was this approach chosen over alternatives?

## Provenance Chain

If this project builds on previous work, link to the sources:

- **Parent project:** (if forked or imported from another FlexOS project)
- **External sources:** (GitHub repos, websites, documents that informed this)
- **AI models used:** (which models generated the initial content)
