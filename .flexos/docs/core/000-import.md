### 2. Data Quality & Critical Gaps

The quality of the available data is low and entirely derived from an extremely outdated website (copyright 1997-2011). The project's success is critically dependent on filling these gaps through client interviews.

*   **[GAP] Updated Service Portfolio:** The current service list is over a decade old. We have **no information** on their current offerings. Do they support modern Microsoft ERPs (Dynamics 365)? Do they offer Azure/cloud services? What is their cybersecurity posture? This is the most critical information gap.
*   **[GAP] Social Proof:** There is a **total absence** of client testimonials, logos, case studies, or success stories. This is the biggest credibility weakness to overcome.
*   **[GAP] Human Element:** The business is faceless. We have **no names, photos, or biographies** for the founder or key team members.
*   **[GAP] Target Client Profile:** Beyond "medium to large enterprises," we have no specific information on the industries they serve or the typical roles of their client contacts (e.g., CTO, IT Manager, CFO).
*   **[GAP] Project Details:** The "what they do" is high-level. We have **no concrete examples** of the problems they have solved or the results they have achieved for clients.

### 3. Discarded Data

All research data pertaining to other companies named "Wimmer EDV" in Eferding, Wiesen, Pöls, and Schwanenstadt has been **permanently discarded**. It is irrelevant and would poison the redesign strategy with factually incorrect assumptions. Any conflicting information from the initial "Brand Brief" regarding a "local SMB provider" has also been superseded by the verified facts about Wimmer Consulting GmbH's enterprise focus.
