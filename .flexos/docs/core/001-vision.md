# Vision & Strategy

> The north star document. Defines what this product is, who it's for, and why it matters. Everything else flows from here.

## Vision Statement

A clear, aspirational statement about what this product will become. Not a feature list — a future state. What does the world look like when this product succeeds?

## Mission

The practical version of the vision. What does this product DO, day to day, for its users? One sentence that anyone on the team can repeat.

## Problem

What pain point does this solve? Be specific — not "people need better tools" but "freelance photographers lose 3 hours per week chasing clients for gallery approvals." Include evidence if available.

## Solution

How does this product solve the problem? The elevator pitch. What's the core mechanism that makes things better?

## Target Users

### Primary Persona

Describe the main user in detail — their role, frustrations, goals, technical comfort level, and what "success" looks like for them. Give them a name.

### Secondary Personas

Other user types who benefit from the product. Admins, managers, collaborators, viewers — whoever else interacts with the system.

## Unique Value Proposition

What makes this different from alternatives? Not just "better UI" — what's the structural advantage? Why will users switch from what they're doing now?

## Success Metrics

How do we know this is working? Define 3-5 measurable outcomes:

- **Activation:** (what does a successful first session look like?)
- **Engagement:** (what does regular usage look like?)
- **Retention:** (what keeps users coming back?)
- **Growth:** (how does the product spread?)

## Non-Goals

Equally important: what is this product NOT? What features, markets, or approaches are explicitly out of scope? This prevents scope creep and keeps the team focused.

## Competitive Landscape

What alternatives exist? Direct competitors, indirect substitutes, and the "do nothing" option. Where does this product fit in the market?
