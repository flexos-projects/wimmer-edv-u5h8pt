This inventory is focused on delivering immediate credibility and generating qualified leads for Wimmer EDV's high-value consulting services.

### P1: Launch Essentials (Must-Have for Relaunch)

These features are non-negotiable for establishing the brand's credibility and core business function.

*   **Responsive, Professional Design:** A fully modern, mobile-first design that is fast, clean, and communicates enterprise-level competence.
*   **Detailed Service Pages:** Unique, structured pages for each core offering (e.g., AS/400 Modernization, Dynamics AX Support, Veeam Data Protection). Each page must detail the service, its business value, and their approach.
*   **Compelling "About Us" Page:** Tells the "Since 1997" story, emphasizing stability, experience, and the company's philosophy. This is a primary trust-builder.
*   **High-Intent "Request a Consultation" Form:** A detailed contact form designed to pre-qualify leads. It will ask for more than just name/email; it should include fields for "Current System," "Project Goals," and "Company Size" to filter for serious inquiries.
*   **"Client Success" / Case Study Section:** A dedicated page to showcase their work. Even if it launches with only one or two case studies (or a "Coming Soon" promise), the existence of the section itself signals a focus on results.
*   **Partner Logo Showcase:** A prominent section on the homepage and a dedicated part of the "About Us" page to display logos of key partners like Microsoft and Veeam.
*   **Standard Legal Pages:** Impressum (Imprint) and Datenschutz (Privacy Policy) that are easily accessible and legally compliant.
*   **Click-to-Call Functionality:** All phone numbers must be tappable on mobile devices for immediate contact.

### P2: Month 1-3 (Post-Launch Enhancements)

Once the core site is live and stable, we focus on deepening engagement and building authority.

*   **Populate Case Studies:** Work with the client to write and publish at least 3-5 detailed case studies, making this the most compelling section of the site.
*   **"Our Team" Page/Section:** Introduce the founder and key consultants with professional photos and bios. This adds a crucial human element and showcases the depth of the team's expertise.
*   **"Insights" Blog Launch:** Publish the first 3-5 thought leadership articles based on the content strategy. This begins the long-term SEO and authority-building effort.
*   **Testimonial Integration:** Weave short, powerful client quotes throughout the homepage and relevant service pages.

### P3: Future Roadmap (6-12 Months)

Long-term features to expand the site's role as a marketing asset.

*   **Gated Content (Whitepapers/Guides):** Create in-depth guides (e.g., "The Complete Guide to AS/400 Modernization") available for download in exchange for a business email. A powerful lead-generation tool for the top of the funnel.
*   **Service-Specific Landing Pages:** Develop stripped-down landing pages for specific digital ad campaigns (e.g., a page focused solely on "Dynamics AX to D365 Migration").
*   **Webinar/Event System:** A simple system to announce and manage sign-ups for educational webinars targeting their niche audience.
