### 1. Direct Competitors in their Area/Niche

    *   Services: Similar offerings (hardware, software, network, security, cloud, backup, support).

    *   Services: Comprehensive IT infrastructure, security, cloud solutions, Microsoft 365, backup.
    *   Focus: "Ihr Spezialist für IT Infrastruktur, IT Sicherheit und Cloud Lösungen." Appears to target a slightly more corporate segment, but still local.

    *   Focus: "Ihre EDV-Experten im Salzkammergut." Long-standing presence (since 1990).

### 2. How do competitors present themselves online?

This is a critical finding. **Almost all direct competitors present themselves with modern, professional, and responsive websites.**

*   **EDV-Service Eder:** Clean, modern design, excellent responsiveness, clear navigation, professional imagery. Good use of contact forms and services overview.
*   **IT-Service Lehner:** Modern, responsive design with clear calls to action, good use of icons and graphics to explain services. Professional photography.
*   **Gartner IT Solutions:** *Very* slick and modern website. Excellent user experience, strong branding, professional visuals, clear differentiation of services. Feels high-end.
*   **ITS Steininger:** Modern, professional, and well-structured site. Clearly outlines services, expertise, and partner certifications. Responsive and easy to navigate.
*   **Netland Computer GmbH:** Also a very modern, comprehensive, and professional website. Extensive content, clear service categories, and a professional look that conveys reliability and expertise.

**Observation:** Wimmer EDV's current website (which appears to be from the early 2000s, non-responsive, with outdated design elements) stands out significantly for being *dated* compared to its local direct competitors.

### 3. What's the standard in their industry for websites?

Based on the analysis of direct competitors, the standard for IT service providers in the Schwanenstadt/Salzkammergut region is **modern, professional, responsive websites** that clearly articulate services, highlight expertise, and offer a good user experience.

To broaden this, a quick look at other professional services in the area:

*   **Law Firms (Rechtsanwälte) in Schwanenstadt/Vöcklabruck:**
    *   e.g., Kanzlei Dr. Zeilinger (Vöcklabruck): `https://www.ra-zeilinger.at/` - Modern, clean, responsive.
    *   e.g., Rechtsanwalt Mag. Dr. Andreas Eder (Schwanenstadt): `https://www.ra-eder.at/` - Modern, professional, responsive.
    *   *Finding:* Most law firms in the area also maintain modern, professional, and responsive websites.
*   **Tax Consultants (Steuerberater) in Schwanenstadt/Vöcklabruck:**
    *   e.g., RGT Wirtschaftsprüfung & Steuerberatung (Vöcklabruck): `https://rgt.at/` - Modern, extensive, corporate site.
    *   e.g., Steuerberatung Gschwandtner & Partner (Schwanenstadt): `https://www.gschwandtner.cc/` - Modern, clean, good overview.
    *   *Finding:* Similar to law firms, tax consultants in the region also largely use modern web presentations.

**Conclusion on Industry Standard:** For professional services, including IT consultants, in the Schwanenstadt/Salzkammergut region, a modern, responsive, and professionally designed website is the **expected standard.** Wimmer EDV's current site is significantly below this standard.

### 4. Price Positioning

Price positioning is inferred from available signals:

*   **Wimmer EDV (current perception):** Given the dated website and lack of explicit premium branding, Wimmer EDV *currently appears* to be positioned as mid-range or even budget-friendly, primarily relying on existing client relationships and local word-of-mouth. There are no signals for premium pricing.
*   **Competitors:**
    *   **EDV-Service Eder, IT-Service Lehner, ITS Steininger, Netland Computer:** Their modern, professional websites and comprehensive service offerings suggest a **mid-to-premium** price positioning. They project professionalism and expertise that commands a fair, competitive rate.
    *   **Gartner IT Solutions:** With its particularly slick website and emphasis on "specialist" solutions, it leans towards a **premium** positioning.

**Opportunity for Wimmer EDV:** A modern, professional website would immediately allow Wimmer EDV to reposition itself more clearly in the **mid-to-premium** segment, aligning with the perceived quality and value offered by its competitors.

### 5. What makes this business different?

Based on their current website and common differentiators for smaller IT firms:

*   **Longevity:** "Seit 1999" (since 1999) – This is a good track record, demonstrating stability and experience. While not the oldest (Netland is older), it's a solid foundation.
*   **Local Roots:** Explicitly based in Schwanenstadt, serving the Salzkammergut region. This implies strong local knowledge and accessibility, which can be a significant advantage for local businesses seeking personalized service.
*   **Personalized Service / "Einzelunternehmen" (Sole Proprietorship):** The "e.U." suffix suggests a smaller, more hands-on operation. This often translates to highly personalized service, direct communication with the owner/expert, and a tailored approach, which can be very appealing to SMEs tired of feeling like just another number to larger firms.
*   **Focus (Implied):** Their service list is broad but hints at a focus on practical, reliable IT solutions for small to medium-sized businesses without over-complicating things.

**Missing/Not Evident:** Specific unique technical specializations, explicit certifications (beyond general Microsoft partner, if applicable, not stated), or patented solutions. Their differentiation currently lies more in their local presence, longevity, and implied personalized service.

### 6. Service Area

*   **Local:** Schwanenstadt, Austria (their primary base).
*   **Regional:** Explicitly states "Region Salzkammergut" on their current website. This covers surrounding towns and districts (e.g., Vöcklabruck, Gmunden).
*   **National/International:** No indication or claim of national or international service. Their focus is clearly local/regional.

## Implications for the Redesign

**The redesign is not just a nice-to-have; it's a critical strategic necessity.**

*   **Competitive Disadvantage:** Wimmer EDV is currently at a significant competitive disadvantage online. Their website does not reflect the professionalism or capabilities that local businesses expect from an IT service provider, especially when compared to virtually all their direct competitors.
*   **Opportunity for Repositioning:** A modern, professional, and responsive website will:
    *   **Match or Exceed Competitors:** The goal should be to at least match the quality of sites like EDV-Service Eder and IT-Service Lehner, ideally aiming for the level of Gartner IT Solutions or ITS Steininger to truly stand out.
    *   **Justify Price Positioning:** A slick site will enable Wimmer EDV to confidently position itself in the mid-to-premium range, reflecting the value of their expertise and experience.
    *   **Communicate USPs:** The new site can effectively highlight Wimmer EDV's longevity, strong local roots, and the benefit of personalized, direct, and reliable service that often comes with a more focused firm.
    *   **Build Trust & Credibility:** A modern site signals competence, reliability, and an understanding of contemporary business needs – all essential for an IT service provider.

The redesign will transform Wimmer EDV's online presence from a potential deterrent to a powerful asset that aligns with, and potentially surpasses, the current industry standards in their service area.
