Wimmer EDV has an **exceptionally strong and positive reputation** based on direct customer feedback. With a 4.9-star rating on Google (30 reviews) and 5.0 stars on Facebook (10 recommendations), customers consistently praise their speed, competence, friendly service, reliability, and fair pricing. The absence of complaints is noteworthy.

Their long history since 1989 and a robust list of vendor partnerships (Microsoft, Veeam, ESET, etc.) provide further evidence of their stability and technical capabilities.
