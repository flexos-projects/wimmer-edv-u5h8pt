**Summary of Online Presence:**

Wimmer EDV has a solid foundational online presence for a small to medium-sized local business, particularly in Austria. They effectively utilize Google Business Profile and key national/local directories like WKO, Herold.at, and FirmenABC.at. The presence of an article on meinbezirk.at also provides valuable local credibility and background.

However, they currently lack a social media presence on platforms like Facebook, Instagram, or YouTube, which are often used for direct customer engagement and content marketing. The LinkedIn presence is limited to the CEO's personal profile, not a company page.

**Key Strengths:** Strong directory listings, positive Google reviews, and a well-managed Google Business Profile.
**Areas for Potential Growth:** Developing a social media strategy (starting with Facebook) and potentially a LinkedIn company page to engage with customers and industry peers.
