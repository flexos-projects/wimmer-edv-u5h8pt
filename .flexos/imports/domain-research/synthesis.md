### The Story

The narrative is one of **deep-seated, legacy technical expertise**. Founded in 1997, Wimmer Consulting GmbH is not a modern cloud-first startup; they are an established institution born in the era of complex, on-premise enterprise systems.

Their specific mention of **IBM AS/400 and Microsoft Dynamics AX** points to a history of serving established, medium-to-large businesses with mission-critical infrastructure. Their story is about stability, longevity, and the rare ability to manage the powerful, complex systems that many modern IT firms have forgotten. They are the seasoned experts who understand the foundational technology that still runs many successful companies. The "young, dynamic team" mentioned on their site is a generic statement; their true story lies in their decades of experience.

### What They're Known For

Based on their website's content, their reputation is built on **specialized, high-stakes expertise**.

*   **Legacy System Mastery:** The dedicated AS/400 page is their most unique differentiator. Businesses still running these systems need a rare kind of expert, and Wimmer positions themselves as that expert.
*   **High-End ERP Implementation:** Focusing on Microsoft Dynamics AX (a complex, high-end ERP) suggests they work on large, intricate projects, not simple small-business IT.
*   **Virtualization & Data Protection:** The highly detailed Veeam page showcases a strong competency in modern data protection for virtualized environments, acting as a bridge from their legacy expertise to more current technologies.
*   **Key Partnerships (Implied):** Microsoft (for Dynamics AX) and Veeam. These are their primary proof points of technical alignment.

### The Competitive Reality

The provided competitive analysis (for Schwanenstadt) is irrelevant. However, the reality for Wimmer Consulting GmbH in Schleissheim is stark.

*   **Their Website is a Liability:** The current site, with a copyright of "1997-2011," is non-responsive, uses outdated image-based navigation, and has broken contact forms. It actively undermines their credibility. In the IT industry, an ancient website signals that the company itself is obsolete.
*   **Perception vs. Reality:** While they likely possess immense technical skill, their online presence projects the image of a dormant or defunct business. Any potential client searching for them will be met with a site that inspires zero confidence.
*   **The Industry Standard:** The standard for *any* professional services firm today, let alone an IT consultancy, is a modern, responsive, secure (HTTPS) website. They are not just behind the curve; they are off the map entirely.

The opportunity is immense because the bar is so low. A modern website won't just be an improvement; it will be a complete resurrection of their public-facing identity.

### Content Goldmine

The current site contains valuable seeds for new, authentic content.

*   **Legacy-to-Modern Case Studies:** Their AS/400 and Dynamics AX expertise is a goldmine. The new site can feature content on "Modernizing Your AS/400 Environment," "Migrating from Dynamics AX," or "Integrating Legacy Systems with Cloud Services." This positions their old skills as a modern-day asset.
*   **Veeam Partnership:** The technical details on the Veeam page can be repurposed into a modern "Data Backup & Disaster Recovery" service page, highlighting their partnership.
*   **Decades of Experience:** The "since 1997" fact is a powerful trust signal. This can be the cornerstone of the "About Us" page, emphasizing stability and reliability.
*   **The "Why":** The knowledge for the new site isn't on the current pages; it's in the owner's head. The goldmine is 27 years of project experience that needs to be extracted through interviews.

### The Gaps

The gap between their implied expertise and their online presence is total. The new website must address these critical deficiencies:

*   **Modern Design & Technology:** The site needs to be built from scratch to be responsive, fast, and secure.
*   **Social Proof:** There are **zero** testimonials, client logos, or case studies. This is the single biggest credibility gap.
*   **Human Element:** No names, photos, or bios of the team. The business is faceless.
*   **Updated Service Portfolio:** The services listed are dated. What about Microsoft 365, Azure, modern cybersecurity, managed services? The site must reflect what they do in 2024, not 2011.
*   **Clear Calls-to-Action (CTAs):** The site lacks any clear next step for a visitor. There are no "Request a Consultation," "Learn More," or "Contact Us for an Analysis" buttons.
*   **SEO Foundation:** The current site is invisible to search engines. It needs basic on-page SEO, keyword strategy, and a modern structure.

### Redesign Recommendations

The redesign is a **strategic imperative for survival and growth**. It's not a refresh; it's a relaunch.

*   **The #1 Goal: Establish Instant Credibility.** The new site must immediately communicate that Wimmer Consulting GmbH is a modern, professional, and highly competent IT firm. It must erase any doubt created by the old site within the first 5 seconds.
*   **Core Strategy: Frame Legacy as Expertise.**
    *   Don't hide the AS/400 and Dynamics AX experience—celebrate it. Create dedicated pages that frame this as a high-value niche specialization for established companies.
    *   Build a bridge to the present by showcasing modern services like Cloud Integration, Cybersecurity, and Managed IT Services alongside the legacy offerings.
*   **Key Features & Content:**
    1.  **Professional, Responsive Design:** A clean, modern aesthetic that works flawlessly on all devices.
    2.  **"Our Expertise" Section (Services):** Clearly structured pages for modern service clusters (e.g., IT Infrastructure, Cloud Solutions, Cybersecurity) and a dedicated "Specialized Expertise" section for legacy systems.
    3.  **"Case Studies" or "Client Success" Page:** This is non-negotiable. They must provide at least 2-3 examples of problems they solved for clients to prove their value.
    4.  **Prominent Social Proof:** A homepage section with client logos and pull-quotes from testimonials.
    5.  **An "About Us" That Tells Their Story:** Introduce the founder/key people with photos. Emphasize the "Since 1997" history as a story of stability and deep experience.
    6.  **Clear Contact & CTAs:** A functional contact form and compelling calls-to-action on every service page (e.g., "Schedule a Free IT Assessment").
    7.  **Language:** The site must be in professional German, as that is the language of their business.
