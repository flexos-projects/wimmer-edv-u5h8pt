Okay, I can help you compile an actionable asset report from the image triage results. Just paste the `{{p10_analyze_images.results}}` content into the code block below, and I will generate the markdown document.

```text
{{p10_analyze_images.results}}
```

Once you provide the results, I will process them and give you the complete markdown document.
