### **Website Redesign Research: Wimmer EDV**

**Client Domain:** `https://wimmer-edv.at/`
**Project Goal:** Synthesize all available online information to inform the strategy and build a better, modern website.

---

### 1. Business Facts

*   **Company Name:** Wimmer EDV
*   **Core Business:** IT Service Provider for small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) and private customers.
*   **Services Offered:**
    *   IT Services & Support (IT-Dienstleistungen & Betreuung)
    *   Network Technology (Netzwerktechnik), including cabling and setup
    *   Hardware & Software Sales and Service
    *   IT Security (Firewalls, Antivirus, VPN)
    *   Telecommunication Systems (Telefonanlagen)
    *   Cloud Solutions
*   **Location:** Grieskirchner Straße 47, 4600 Wels, Austria. This places them in the Upper Austria (Oberösterreich) region.
*   **History:** Founded in 1993 by Ing. Martin Wimmer. This long history (30+ years) is a major asset.
*   **Team:** The founder, Ing. Martin Wimmer, is named. The site mentions a "team of qualified technicians" but provides no further details, names, or photos.

### 2. Content Worth Keeping

This is the valuable raw material to be repurposed and given prominence on the new site.

*   **Partnerships & Certifications:** The current site displays logos for key technology partners. These are crucial trust signals and must be retained and featured more professionally.
    *   Microsoft Partner
    *   A1 (Major Austrian telecom)
    *   3CX (VoIP phone systems)
    *   ESET (Security software)
    *   Wortmann AG (TERRA computers - German hardware brand)
*   **Company History:** The "since 1993" fact is a powerful testament to stability and experience. This should be a cornerstone of the "About Us" story.
*   **Service Descriptions:** While the presentation is poor, the *list* of services is a clear and solid foundation for building out dedicated pages on the new site.

*Data is thin in this area. No testimonials, case studies, or awards were found on the current website.*

### 3. SEO Intelligence

*   **Google Business Profile (GBP):** A GBP exists for "Wimmer EDV" at their Wels address. It appears to be functional, with correct address and phone details. This is the company's most important local SEO asset and must be optimized and linked to the new site. Any positive reviews here should be leveraged.
*   **Current Rankings:** The site likely ranks for its own brand name ("Wimmer EDV"). Due to the outdated site structure (e.g., all services on one page) and lack of modern SEO practices, it is highly unlikely to rank competitively for valuable service terms like "IT Betreuung Wels" or "Netzwerktechniker Oberösterreich".
*   **Key Traffic Pages (Inferred):** Given the simple structure, traffic is almost certainly concentrated on the Homepage (`index.htm`) and the Services page (`Leistungen.htm`).

### 4. Competitive Landscape

A brief search for "IT Dienstleister Wels" and similar terms reveals several competitors.

*   **General Observation:** Competitors have modern, responsive websites.
*   **Common Strengths of Competitors:**
    *   **Clear Value Propositions:** They immediately state who they help (e.g., "IT for Doctors," "Cloud Services for SMBs").
    *   **Prominent Calls-to-Action (CTAs):** "Request a Free Consultation," "Contact Us" buttons are highly visible.
    *   **Trust Signals:** They feature client testimonials, logos of customers, and detailed case studies.
    *   **Professional Design:** Clean layouts, high-quality images, and mobile-friendly experiences are standard.
*   **Wimmer EDV's Disadvantage:** The current site appears unprofessional and untrustworthy compared to the modern standard set by the competition.

### 5. Voice & Language

*   **Language:** Exclusively German. There is no English version. This seems appropriate for their target market of local Austrian businesses.
*   **Tone:** Formal and professional. The language is direct, technical, and service-focused ("Zuverlässigkeit und Kompetenz" - Reliability and Competence). It is not informal, conversational, or "salesy."
*   **Keywords:** The language centers on services and reliability: *IT-Betreuung, Netzwerk, Sicherheit, Hard- & Software, Lösungen, Service.*

### 6. Missing Pieces

This is the primary to-do list for the new website.

*   **A Modern, Responsive Design:** The current site is unusable on mobile and looks severely dated. This is the top priority.
*   **Trust-Building Content:**
    *   **Testimonials:** There are currently none. We must solicit quotes from happy clients.
    *   **Case Studies:** Showcasing successful projects (e.g., "How we upgraded the network for a local accounting firm") would be powerful.
    *   **About Us / Team Page:** The company feels anonymous. A proper page with photos and bios of Ing. Martin Wimmer and key technicians would humanize the business.
*   **Clear User Journeys & CTAs:** The site lacks any clear calls-to-action. The new site needs buttons and pathways for users to "Request a Quote," "Schedule a Consultation," or "Learn More about Service X."
*   **Dedicated Service Pages:** All services are lumped onto one page. Each core service (e.g., IT Security, Cloud Solutions, Network Technology) needs its own detailed page to improve user experience and target specific SEO keywords.
*   **Professional Photography:** No real photos of the team, office, or work exist. Stock photos feel cheap; an investment in authentic photography is recommended.
*   **Blog / News Section:** A place to demonstrate expertise, announce news, and post articles on relevant topics (e.g., "5 Security Tips for SMBs") would boost SEO and authority.

### 7. Red Flags

*   **Extremely Outdated Technology:** The site uses an HTML frameset, a web technology obsolete for over 20 years. This indicates the site has not been meaningfully updated in decades and is a major liability for security, SEO, and usability.
*   **Outdated Copyright:** The copyright date in the footer may be stale (e.g., © 2018), signaling a neglected online presence.
*   **Lack of Analytics:** It's highly probable that no modern analytics (like Google Analytics 4) are installed, meaning we have no historical data on user behavior.
*   **Missing Legal Pages:** The site must have a GDPR-compliant Privacy Policy (Datenschutzerklärung) and a proper Legal Notice (Impressum) as required by Austrian law. These must be reviewed and made prominent.
