This is a note session — a self-contained folder for capturing work context. Each session has:
- note.md (this file) — append-only log of decisions, observations, and progress
- changelog.md — structured record of what changed and why
- files/ — reference files, screenshots, data dumps used during this session

The JSON block below links this note to its related files. The AI reads this to understand what context is available for this session.
